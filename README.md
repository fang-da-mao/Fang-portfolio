# Fang-portfolio
Welcome to my public portfolio for telling story with data class at CMU!

# About me
I am Nan Fang (Nancy), a first year student from MISM program. 

I am born and raised in Beijing, a totally Chinese food lover. I traveled to Canada a lot, one reason is my family is there, another reason is Canada has really nice Chinese food.

I used to study math and information, not an expert in CS, but I would say I am an expert in math :)

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make a good design for data visulization from many perspectives including color, text content, tools, etc.

I plan to become a data analyst after graduation :) BTW I really love STATISTICS.

# Portfolio
Here is the place where I update my learning process of data visulization.
