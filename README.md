Welcome to my public portfolio for telling story with data class at CMU!

# About me
I am Nan Fang (Nancy), a first year student from MISM program. 
I am born and raised in Beijing, a totally Chinese food lover. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make a good design for data visulization from many perspectives including color, text content, tools, etc.

I plan to become a data analyst after graduation :) BTW I really love STATISTICS.
